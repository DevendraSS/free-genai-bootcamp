            <text>Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two main clauses:</text>
            <clauses>
                <clause>Bears are at the door.</clause>
                <clause>Did you leave the garbage out?</clause>
            </clauses>
            <text>We'll need to figure out how to connect these clauses in Japanese.</text>
            <text>Here's a possible sentence structure:</text>
            <sentence_structure>[Clause 1] + [Clause 2] (using a question word)</sentence_structure>
            <text>Your turn! What Japanese words can you use to express "Bears are at the door"?</text>

        <clues_and_considerations>
            <clue>The first sentence is a question about whether the student saw the raven this morning. Think about how to structure a question in Japanese, focusing on the time, subject, object, and action verb.</clue>
            <clue>The second sentence describes an ongoing action in the past. Consider how to express "was looking at" in Japanese, using the past continuous form.</clue>
            <clue>Remember to use the correct particles to connect the words. For example, the particle "を" is often used to mark the object of a verb.</clue>
            <clue>The word "見る" (miru) means "to see," but in the past continuous form, it becomes "見ていた" (miteita), meaning "was looking at."</clue>
            <clue>The word "庭" (niwa) means "garden," and "私たちの" (watashitachi no) means "our." You can combine these to say "our garden" as "私たちの庭" (watashitachi no niwa).</clue>
