## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure
The reason is becuase there is a concern about privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatlt raise in cost

They want to invest in an AI PC where they can afford spend of 10-15k
They have 300 actove students, and students are located in Nagasaki.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an invetment of 10-15k

We are just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrigthted materials so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.
